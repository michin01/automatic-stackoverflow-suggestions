"50610079","1","","","2018-05-30 17:05:15","","0","33","<p>I have a code like this in my React application:</p>

<pre><code>import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import ComponentB from './ComponentB';

class ComponentA extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.condition = this.props.condition;
    }

    render() {
         return ReactDOM.createPortal(
            &lt;div id=""abc""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;,
            document.getElementById('xyz'))
    }

    componentDidMount() {
        ReactDOM.createPortal(
            &lt;div&gt;
                {

                    this.condition &amp;&amp;
                    &lt;ComponentB /&gt;
                }
            &lt;/div&gt;,
            document.body)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, I want to render <code>ComponentB</code> only after <code>ComponentA</code> has been mounted to DOM. Hence I have put the code for <code>ComponentA</code> inside <code>componentDidMount</code> of <code>ComponentB</code>. But still <code>ComponentB</code> is rendering before <code>ComponentA</code> has finished mounting to DOM. </p>

<p>Why is this happening and what's the solution to this problem?</p>

<p>Tried looking for examples of React going bonkers when you render into body so I could test it out with createPortal but I wasn't able to find any.</p>

<p>To put things into context, here's a sample usage I'm speaking about:</p>

<pre><code>import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

export default class Modal extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return ReactDOM.createPortal(
            &lt;div className='modalContainer'&gt;
                &lt;div className='modalBox'&gt;
                    {this.props.children}
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;,
            document.body
        );
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Haven't run into any issues with this pattern but I'd like to know if there are consequences as I start adding more libraries.</p>
